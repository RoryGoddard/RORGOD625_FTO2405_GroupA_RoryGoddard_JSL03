# [JSL03] Project Submission: Which one is which? Declarative or Imperative?!

# Project Overview

In this project we were tasked with identifying which code blocks were imperative or declaritive and giving justifications for our reasoning. This forced me to learn about concepts such as immutability, state change, control flow, and abstraction. I enjoyed this challenge and I feel I have a much firmer understanding of the paradigms of programming now having completed it.

# Challenges Faced
The only challenges faced here were really getting a solid understanding of the underlying topics in order to construct solid reasoning, and besides that, presentation work. My presentation skills are not perfect, I can tell this, however I feel each time I do a presentation, I am getting better with it and it is a small margin easier than the previous one. So I do feel I am growing in this sense.

# Final Thoughts
I am coming out of this knowing how to indentify whether something is imperative or declarative and that means I am able to understand when the state is being changed, what the control flow looks like, whether something is immutable or not and what the consequences are of that, and I feel I can more confidently abstraction within my programming.
